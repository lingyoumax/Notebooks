# Statistical inference I: Foundations of statistical models
## Measure Theory

Let $\Omega \neq \emptyset$ be an arbitrary set. For $A \subseteq \Omega$, the set $A^c := \{\omega \in \Omega \mid \omega \notin A\}$ is called the complement of $A$ in $\Omega$. The set $\mathcal{P}(\Omega) = \{B \mid B \subseteq \Omega\}$ is the power set of $\Omega$ and contains all subsets of $\Omega$.

### Example (Dice)

A six-sided unbiased dice is rolled. The goal is to find a suitable and rigorous mathematical concept of this real-world random experiment. To represent this experiment, the space $\Omega$ should include all elementary events that can occur during the roll, i.e., the occurrence of any of the six numbers. For the simple dice roll, this means

$\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$.

In the following, we will usually refer to $\Omega$ as the set of all elementary events that can occur. But what if the outcome of the dice roll is not fully observable? Perhaps we only receive the information whether the outcome number is odd or even. The set of all sets of elementary events that are observable are modeled in the following definition of a $\sigma$-algebra.

### Definition ($\sigma$-Algebra)

A set $A \subseteq \mathcal{P}(\Omega)$ is called a $\sigma$-algebra on $\Omega$ if:

- $\Omega \in A$,
- $A \in A \Rightarrow A^c \in A$,
- $A_1, A_2, \ldots \in A \Rightarrow \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n \in A$.

Elements of $A$ are called measurable sets. The tuple $(\Omega, A)$ is called a measurable space.

A $\sigma$-algebra is designed to assign a measure to an observed event.

### Remark

The properties of a $\sigma$-algebra have the following interpretations in the context of modeling a random experiment (i.e., the process by which an observation is made):

- We should be able to observe that an experiment has taken place,
- If the occurrence of an event is observable, we should also be able to observe the case that the event has not occurred,
- If the occurrence of a countable sequence of events is observableï¼Œwe should also be able toobserve that one of these events has occurred. This translates to a logical OR relationship between events.

### Example (Trivial $\sigma$-algebras)

The set $A_1 = \{\emptyset, \Omega\}$ and the power set $A_2 = \mathcal{P}(\Omega)$ are $\sigma$-algebras.

### Example (Dice)

As stated above the space of elementary events $\Omega$ of a dice roll is given by

$\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$.

If the number rolled is observable the $\sigma$-algebra has the following form

$A_1 = \{\emptyset, \{1\}, \ldots, \{6\}, \{1, 2, 3\}, \{5, 6\}, \{1, 2, 3, \ldots\}, \Omega\} = \mathcal{P}(\Omega)$.

If only the parity of the rolled number is observable, i.e., odd or even, the $\sigma$-algebra has the following form

$A_2 = \{\emptyset, \{1, 3, 5\}, \{2, 4, 6\}, \Omega\}$.

The ability to measure occurring events (or sets of elementary events) contained in the $\sigma$-algebra has been ensured. The next step is to assign them a value (e.g., a probability). To be in accordance with the natural understanding of the behavior of probabilities, the mapping from the $\sigma$-algebra to the reals should satisfy certain properties, which are collected in the following definition of a measure.

### Definition (Probability Measure)

Let $A$ be a $\sigma$-Algebra. A map $\mu : A \to [0, \infty)$ is called a measure on $A$ if

- $\mu(\emptyset) = 0$,
- for pairwise disjoint sets $A_1, A_2, \ldots \in A$, it holds that

  $\mu\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n\right) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \mu(A_n)$.

A measure is called *finite* if $\mu(\Omega) < \infty$. A measure is called *probability measure* if $\mu(\Omega) = 1$. Probability measures are denoted by $\mathbb{P}$.

### Remark

For a probability measure $\mathbb{P}$ on a measurable space $(\Omega, A)$, it holds that

$\mathbb{P}(A) \in [0, 1], \quad \forall A \in A$.

This is based on the second defining property of measure and the property of non-negativity.

### Remark

It is necessary to assume disjointedness in the second property of the definition: For $A_1 = \{1, 2\}$ (i.e., rolling a 1 or a 2 in a dice toss) and $A_2 = \{2, 3\}$, it holds that

$\mathbb{P}(\{1,2\}) = \frac{1}{3}$ and $\mathbb{P}(\{2,3\}) = \frac{1}{3}$,

but

$\mathbb{P}(\{1,2\} \cup \{2,3\}) = \mathbb{P}(\{1,2,3\}) = \frac{1}{2} \neq \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3} = \mathbb{P}(\{1,2\}) + \mathbb{P}(\{2,3\})$.

This can be fixed by subtracting the measure of the intersection of the sets.

### Definition (Probability space)

Let $\Omega$ be a set of elementary events, $A$ be a $\sigma$-algebra on $\Omega$ and $\mathbb{P}$ a probability measure on $A$. The tuple $(\Omega, A, \mathbb{P})$ is called probability space. Every $A \in A$ is called event. For $A \in A$, $\mathbb{P}(A)$ is called as the probability of $A$.
